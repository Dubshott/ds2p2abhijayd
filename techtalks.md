This is where all the tech talk information goes! 

# Week 1

**Notes**
- We spent more working with the different logic and different types of code like linked lists
- A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

**Hard Things**
- Some things that I found difficult was going through the different problems this time
- The logic was much different from normal projects, which just complicated the entire process

# Week 0

**Notes**
- [Link to Notes](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-0---Data-Structures)
- I learned a lot from this tech talk actually because we talked a lot more about the different data structures and I learned the difference between the imperative and object oriented paradigms. I saw that there were different path's to follow for each data structure
- We also spent some time looking at the different types of data structures (like hashmaps, tuples, and arrays) and saw if they were primitive or non-primitive types. 
- I think I can spend some time working on some side projects to understand each type of data structure and work on them all together. 

**Hard Things**
- Some things that I found was difficult when going through the code was the increased number of classes and instances that I had to incorporate in the code because it was really weird. 
- Another thing that was weird for me was the logic behind the two way arrays because those were a little weirder than one way tables. I felt like I needed to use more logic to get the tables working. 
- The squirrels are also super weird because it used a lot of for loops and things that I didn't really understand the logic behind.
