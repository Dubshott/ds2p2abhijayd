# Welcome!
Welcome to my Github pages! Here I will be including reflections for each week and including my tech talk notes.

## Week 0

**Hard Things**
- Some things that I found was difficult when going through the code was the increased number of classes and instances that I had to incorporate in the code because it was really weird. 
- Another thing that was weird for me was the logic behind the two way arrays because those were a little weirder than one way tables. I felt like I needed to use more logic to get the tables working. 
- The squirrels are also super weird because it used a lot of for loops and things that I didn't really understand the logic behind. 

**AP Prep**
- I think I need to spend a little more time on arrays and things because it seems like an important concept, but I don't really understand much of it just yet. 
- Another thing that I could spend time on is classes and instances again because it seems like I forgot some of the core concepts of it. 
- One specific thing that I could spend more time learning is the hashmap thing because I am not too familiar with this type of data structure.
