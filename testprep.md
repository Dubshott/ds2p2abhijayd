This is where all my test prep material goes! 

# Week 1

**AP Prep**
- I think I could spend a little more time on arrays again to practice the things from last week
- I also want to spend more time on linked lists and try to completely master the subject
- I should also practice setting up more java files and practice running a proper program

# Week 0

**AP Prep**
- I think I need to spend a little more time on arrays and things because it seems like an important concept, but I don't really understand much of it just yet. 
- Another thing that I could spend time on is classes and instances again because it seems like I forgot some of the core concepts of it. 
- One specific thing that I could spend more time learning is the hashmap thing because I am not too familiar with this type of data structure.
