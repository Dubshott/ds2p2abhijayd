This is where all my test prep material goes! 

# Week 3

**AP Prep**
- I could spend more time working with sorting and bubble sort
- I understand how bubble sort and other sorting methods work, but I was unable to actually create the code for it due to the lack of tiem
- Spend more time on the othe rmethods of sorting because I never really learned those. 

# Week 2

**AP Prep**
- Took a fat L this week mostly on the knowledge of hashmaps and the logic behind a tokenized calculator
- need to focus on learning different data structures and how they can be applied into a real world scenario
- Could work on more logic things to understand how everything actually works. 

# Week 1

**AP Prep**
- I think I could spend a little more time on arrays again to practice the things from last week
- I also want to spend more time on linked lists and try to completely master the subject
- I should also practice setting up more java files and practice running a proper program

# Week 0

**AP Prep**
- I think I need to spend a little more time on arrays and things because it seems like an important concept, but I don't really understand much of it just yet. 
- Another thing that I could spend time on is classes and instances again because it seems like I forgot some of the core concepts of it. 
- One specific thing that I could spend more time learning is the hashmap thing because I am not too familiar with this type of data structure.
